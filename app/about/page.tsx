                Java Jitters is a coffee rating website created as a final project for CS 391 by Perla, Sofia, and Kyle.
                This project started as an assignment, but quickly grew into a fun way to explore and share coffee experiences in the area.
                Our site allows users to rate their favorite café drinks, upload pictures, add locations, and categorize different types of coffees and drinks.
                Whether you love lattes, cappuccinos, or specialty drinks, Java Jitters makes it easy to share your opinions and discover new favorites.
                We hope you enjoy using Java Jitters as much as we enjoyed building it! Thank you for stopping by and feel free to explore the cafés and drinks others have rated.
